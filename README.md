# Perspectra — Project Summary

- Perspectra is an agentic AI EdTech SaaS focused on improving students’ thinking and problem-solving ability, not rote memorization.
The core value is deep personalization through learning signals extracted from user attempts, especially for DSA and coding problems.

## Core Philosophy our idea
* Questions are not the product → learning signal is
* Wrong answers are more valuable than correct ones
* The system continuously builds a cognitive profile of each learner
* Teaching adapts to thinking style, weaknesses, and progress over time
